"""# Convert Statements To Beancount
Convert bank satements to beancount data files.

This script looks in the directory or directories supplied on the
command line, then tries to parse %Y%Y%Y%Y_%M%M.pdf files in that dir
as bank statements.  It puts monthly beancount files, one for each
statement in the dir and also puts "all.beancount" there that has all
the transactions found in those statements.  It also leaves monthly
.txt files, which might be useful if grepping for a transaction.

We should stop trying to manage a bunch of bank statement files and
instead just treat them as ledger.  This code does that.

Try this:  bin/threadfin convert ${OTS_DIR}/finances/statements

This script does a few sanity checks.  First, it runs a series of
sanity checks on the statement import to make sure things add up.  For
example, all the transactions should add up to the difference between
open and closing balance.  Second, the beancount file gets daily
balance assertions.  Third, we run bean-check on the final output
files.  If all those pass, hopefully that means we have done this more
or less correctly.

In transaction.py, there are two variables of interest.  One is
payee_xlation, which lets you specify how to split common credit card
expenses (e.g. our Amazon AWS bill) and the other is cardholders,
which lets you specify who has which debit card.
