# Threadfin

Threadfin is a set of utilities for working with ledger files.  Look
in the "bin" directory for a list of those utilities, then look at
<utility-name>.mdwn for documentation about each utility.  Run the
utility with `threadfin foo bar baz` where "foo" is the name of the
utility and "bar" and "baz" are options to that utility.

For example: `threadfin sort /path/to/ledger/file`.

# config.yaml
The overall config is in config.yaml.

# threadfin.yaml
Each statement dir can have a threadfin.yaml in which additional config can live.

# Convert
Converts statements to beancount files.

One useful feature in the conversion is that we can put info in
threadfin.yaml that allows us to tag and comment matching entries.
For example, this allows us to generate a beancount version of a
credit card statement with the business expenses tagged.  You have the
overhead of having to write auto-tag entries, but you can write them
to match multiple entries so that they capture recurring payments.

# Reconcile
Reconcile two beancount files.  This is useful for a bank account when
you want to make sure the hand-coded entries match the bank
statements.

# Sort
Sorts beancount files by date.
