# OTS Bookkeeping Tools

We use [Beancount](https://github.com/beancount/beancount) for
bookkeeping and light accounting.  This repository holds various tools
to help with that.

## share_postings.py

`share_postings.py` is a beancount plugin that enables you to
automatically split a posting among multiple parties.

## threadfin

threadfin is a set of tools that make beancount easier.  It consists
of several subtools, all of which can be accessed via `threadfin
TOOLNAME`.  See `threadfin/README.mdwn` for more information.
